# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is designed to help bootcamp students effectively store and study notes taken throughout the semester. By regularly uplosing notes to the webpage, students should be able to easily access their notes in order to study efficiently. I built this webpage in order that I could keep consise study notes for myself to use even far after the completion of the bootcamp. This webpage will allow me access my notes from any location at any time so that I never again have to deal with losing paper, forgetting a notebook and other problems that occur. Through the creation of this webpage I was able to dive deeper into the relationship that HTML, CSS and JavaScript all play with one another, expecially through the in-browser console interaction.
